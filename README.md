# Composite-Microservice

## Project Description

Our project is a community-driven web-based app that allows neighbors to trade, lend, or give away items in a simple and trustworthy way. Users can create profiles, list items they no longer need, and browse other postings for things they might be interested in. These items can range from plants to electronics. The goal is to promote sustainability and strengthen community ties by reducing waste and encouraging sharing instead of buying new items. It can be particularly helpful among college students. 

The system is built around three core microservices: a User Service for managing profiles, a trading post service that stores posts and associated items, and a transaction service that records offers, exchanges, and completed trades. A simple browser based interface will allow users to register, view nearby listings, and initiate trades.
